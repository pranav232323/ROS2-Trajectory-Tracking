#  ROS2 Trajectory Tracking

A ROS2-based project that demonstrates **path smoothing** and **PID-based trajectory tracking** for a differential drive robot.  
The robot follows a smooth, spline-generated trajectory in **Gazebo** and visualizes its motion in **RViz**.

---

### ✨ Features
- 🧩 **Path Smoothing** using Natural Cubic Splines  
- ⚙️ **PID Controller** for real-time trajectory tracking  
- 🛰️ **ROS2 Integration** with `/odom` and `/cmd_vel` topics  
- 🧱 Tested in **Gazebo + RViz** simulation  
- 🚧 Ready for future **LiDAR-based obstacle avoidance** extension
